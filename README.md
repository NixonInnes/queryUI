# queryUI
queryUI is a simple GUI to help build, test and use API endpoints with a focus on simplicity.  
The application lets you dispatch typical GET/POST/PUT/DELETE requests to an endpoint; specifying any headers, parameters and/or payload. The endpoint response is simply displayed in a scrollable text field to read, from there you can save it to a file or copy it to the clipboard. The response can also be "prettified" where the application will try to convert it into TOML to make inspecting the data at a glance easier to interpret.
